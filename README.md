# Python-SQL-Project-
Work Related To Python and SQL , The project involves extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) data from various sources, performing in-depth analysis, and generating insightful visualizations. It demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data, draw meaningful insights, and communicate findings effectively.

Objectives
- Extract and preprocess data from various sources
- Perform data cleaning and transformation
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Execute complex SQL queries for data manipulation and analysis
- Visualize data to identify trends and patterns
- Generate actionable insights and recommendations

Tools and Technologies

* Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
* SQL: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL
* Additional Libraries: SQLAlchemy, scikit-learn (for any applied machine learning)
* Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Structure

* data/: Contains raw and cleaned datasets
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations
* sql/: SQL scripts for data extraction, transformation, and querying
* scripts/: Python scripts for data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization
* reports/: Generated reports and dashboards with insights and recommendations
